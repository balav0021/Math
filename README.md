# Project - 1  USING REGRESSION TOOLS TO ANALYSE COVID 19 DATA

Analysing the Impact of Age and Poverty on COVID-19 Deaths



## Description

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the world, and understanding the factors influencing its outcomes is crucial.

In this project, we delve into the world of data analysis to explore the relationship between COVID-19 deaths and two factors: poverty and age.

We're focusing on COVID-19 deaths as our primary measurement. This critical metric directly reflects the impact of the virus on individuals and communities.

The two primary factors of interest are age and poverty. We're interested in how these factors, alone and in interaction, contribute to the variation in COVID-19 death rates.

By conducting a rigorous analysis, we aim to shed light on the complex relationship between demographics, socioeconomic factors, and the pandemic's outcomes.
